# ‚öîÔ∏è CPI Internal Tool 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and extended with a number of basic frameworks & technologies


## Technologies üõ†

The main technologies used throughout this project are: 

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/)
* [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Folder Structure üìñ

The folder structure of this boilerplate is going to follow a [container / component architecture](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.4rmjqneiw) for now. 

**containers/** contains React components which are connected to the redux store, which will be the single source of truth for the data on the platform.

**components/** contain dumb React components, which depend on the aforementioned containers for data.
